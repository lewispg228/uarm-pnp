# uarm-pnp
Pick and place machine using a robotic arm and suction nozzle. It is intended to be used to pick up assembled circuit boards from a cartridge and place them onto a test jig (bed of nails style). Then after successful testing, place them back into another "good" cartridge. If boards to not pass testing, then they will be placed aside for rework.
